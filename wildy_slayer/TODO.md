# TODO

1. Final touches on the calculator:
	- Clean up formatting on "More Info"
	- Include Rev weapon time to approach rate / number of tasks needed to hit rate for both individual weapons and weapons in general

2. Include a seperate webpage with my data for all tasks, and allow sorting by any field (keys/hr, xp/hr, task completion time, superiors/hr)
	- Add a navbar to the calculator when this is done to swap between the two pages
	- Include a "Save to Spreadsheet" option in the calculator to fill out a seperate spreadsheet with their own data.
		- Could allow averaging out of multiple data entries, and a "View Entry" option on the spreadsheet page
