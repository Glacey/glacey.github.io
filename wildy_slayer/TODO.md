# TODO

1. Add CSS to make the page look nicer and scale better to mobile

2. Extra:
	- Include an "about" button with notes on how the calculator works, and why XP and key rates may be different from what's expected (superiors)
	- Add a "reset form" button
	- Include Rev weapon time to approach rate / number of tasks needed to hit rate for both individual weapons and weapons in general

3. Include a seperate webpage with my data for all tasks, and allow sorting by any field (keys/hr, xp/hr, task completion time, superiors/hr)
